1. Run the auth app. This will create custom Chrome profile to work with and login in your EG account

2. Run the collector/autofarmer app. This will collect all giveaway games automatically.
After checkout you can close opened browser

### Questions

1. Why not use my user profile with saved cookies?
* Chrome devtools protocol prevents use of default profile

2. Why 2 progams, not one?
* They do completely different things(auth is responsible for preparing the environment, while collector is responsible for collecting).
Combining them into one program would complicate debugging and make conditions more branched
